# Chrome-Medium-Stats-Grabber

A quick and dirty Google.Chrome extension that grabs story stats from your Medium.com stats page and saves them as a .CSV file. 
* Once installed in Chrome (goto extensions and tick the 'developer mode' option and then add using the 'Load and unpack extension...' button). 
* Log into your Medium.com site, go to your Stats page and scroll to the last item you want the stats for (as Medium uses infinite scrolling). 
* Hit the little 'M' extension icon and it will generate a .CSV file (with "|" delimeters). 

Works for person and publications.
